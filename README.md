# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my journey through the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program. Throughout the course, I've gained hands-on experience and honed my skills in various data engineering technologies and tools.

## Project Highlights

- **Project 1: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra**
  - Implemented robust data models using PostgreSQL for relational databases and Apache Cassandra for NoSQL databases.
  - Developed ETL pipelines to efficiently extract, transform, and load data into the created databases.

- **Project 2: Cloud Data Warehouses with AWS**
  - Leveraged Amazon Redshift to build scalable and high-performance cloud data warehouses.
  - Designed and implemented ETL processes using AWS services like S3 and IAM.

- **Project 3: Data Lakes with Spark**
  - Constructed a data lake using Apache Spark and Amazon S3 for scalable and efficient data processing.
  - Developed Spark ETL jobs to analyze and transform large datasets.

- **Project 4: Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow**
  - Orchestrated data workflows using Apache Airflow, ensuring data pipeline reliability and repeatability.
  - Automated the execution of ETL tasks and monitored pipeline performance.
